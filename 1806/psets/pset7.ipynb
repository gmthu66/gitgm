    "Working with a basis that is *orthogonal* but not *orthonormal* (i.e. not normalizing vectors to length 1) is often convenient, since some other normalization might be convenient in some applications (e.g. in hand calculations square roots are annoying).  In this problem, you will see what happens if you don't normalize an orthogonal basis to unit length.\n",

The latter requires $\\sim mn + n^3$ operations; what does $Pb$ require using your expressions from the previous part?)"
