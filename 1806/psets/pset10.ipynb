    "Suppose that we have a second-order system of ODEs, of the form:\n",

    "\\ddot{x} = \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = A x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is an $m \\times m$ matrix and we use $\\dot{x}$ to denote $dx/dt$ and $\\ddot{x}$ to denote $d^2 x/dt^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A=a$ and $x$ are scalars, this becomes the scalar ODE $\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = a x$.  If we let $\\kappa = \\sqrt{a}$, then it is easy to check that the solutions (assuming $a \\ne 0$) are of the form $x(t) = c e^{+\\kappa t} + d e^{-\\kappa t}$ where $c$ and $d$ are determined by initial conditions $x(0)$ and $\\dot{x}(0)$.\n",

    "**(a)** For the scalar case, show that the same solution can also be written $x(t) = \\alpha \\cosh(\\kappa t) + \\beta \\sinh(\\kappa t)$ in terms of the [hyperbolic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function) cosh and sinh.  What are $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in terms of $c$ and $d$ from the solution above?  What are $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in terms of $x(0)$ and $\\dot{x}(0)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** For the scalar case, if $a < 0$ then we have a purely imaginary $\\sqrt{a} = \\kappa = i\\omega$ for a real $\\omega$.   Using your answers from the previous part, write $x(t)$ as a purely real function (for real initial conditions) in terms of $\\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\sin(\\omega t)$.   Note that $\\cosh(iy) = \\cos(y)$ and $\\sinh(iy) = i\\sin(y)$.\n",

    "**(c)** If $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, find a solution $x(t)$ of $\\ddot{x} = A x$ given by $v$ multiplied by some scalar function $f(t)$.   (Hint: for $v$, remember that $A$ acts like a scalar.  Your function can be written in terms of $\\cosh$ and $\\sinh$ of ...?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Suppose $A$ is diagonalizable, with a basis eigenvectors $v_1, \\ldots, v_m$ and eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_m$.   Expand your solution $x(t)$ in the basis of these eigenvectors by adding up your answers from (c).   If we write the initial conditions in the basis of the eigenvectors, $x(0) = \\sum_k c_k v_k$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = \\sum_k d_k v_k$ for coefficients c and d, you should be able to give an **explicit formula for x(t)** in terms of the $c_k$, $d_k$, $v_k$, and $\\lambda_k$.\n",
