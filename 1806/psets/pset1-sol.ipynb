    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, it is critically important to think about the *shape* (size) of matrices and vectors, and whether operations make sense.   You can multiply $AB$ if $A$ is $m \\times n$ ($m$ rows and $n$ columns) and $B$ is $n \\times p$ — the \"middle\" dimensions need to match up.  You can also add matrices of *equal* sizes, or multiply them by scalars.  Multiplying $Ax$, an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ by an $n$-component vector, can be thought of as a special case of this rule if you think of $x$ as an $n \\times 1$ \"matrix\".  On exams, it is common for people to panic and start writing down nonsense, and an easy way to catch this is to make sure that the operations you are writing down have the correct shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $A$ is a $5\\times 3$ matrix, $B$ is a  $3 \\times 4$ matrix, $x$ is a $3 \\times 1$ matrix (a 3-component column vector), $r$ is a $1 \\times 5$ matrix (a 5-component \"row vector\"), and $s$ is a $1 \\times 3$ matrix (a 3-component row vector).  Give the shape ($m \\times n$) of the result of each of the following operations, or say that the operation makes no sense:\n",

To show that $AB$ is upper-triangular we just need to show that $c_{ij} = 0$ whenever $1 \\leq j < i \\leq n$.  So, suppose $i, j$ are such that $1 \\leq j < i \\leq n$.  By definition of matrix multiplication, $c_{ij} = \\sum_{k = 1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}$. For any $k$ with $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, we then must either have $k < i$ or $k > j$.  But in the first case $a_{ik} = 0$ because $A$ is upper-triangular, and in the second case $b_{kj} = 0$ because $B$ is upper-triangular, so in either case $a_{ik}b_{kj} = 0$.  So the whole sum $c = \\sum_{k = 1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj} = 0$.  Therefore $c_{ij} = 0$ whenever $1 \\leq j < i \\leq n$, so $AB = (c_{ij})$ is upper-triangular.\n",

    "Computing the product $AB$ amounts to computing each of the $m^2$ entries of $AB$ independently.  Each entry of the product is obtained as a product of a $1 \\times m$ row vector in $A$ with a $m \\times 1$ column vector in $B$.  The product of such vectors requires $m$ scalar multiplications and $m - 1$ scalar additions (to add the $m$ products together).  So it requires $2m - 1$ operations to compute each entry of $AB$, for a total of $m^2(2m - 1) = 2m^3 - m^2$ operations in total.  Notice that, for large m, this is dominated by the first term, so the number of operations grows proportional to $m^3$.   (This is sometimes denoted \"$O(m^3)$\" or, more precisely, \"$\\Theta(m^3)$\" *complexity* [in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).)\n",

The ratio is $15996000000/1999000000 = 8.002001\\ldots \\approx 8$.  More simply, since the number of operations goes roughly proportional to $m^3$ for large $m$, doubling $m$ gives a factor of $2^3 = 8$.

The famous [\"Strassen\" algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm) has a count roughly proportional to $m^{2.8074}$, and the [Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%E2%80%93Winograd_algorithm) needs only about $m^{2.24}$ operations (times a constant). In practice, however, these algorithms are virtually never used — they don't become advantageous until $m$ is so huge that arbitrary matrices are too big to multiply anyway.
